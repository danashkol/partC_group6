            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <p style="text-align: left; margin: 20px;">Our Baking Addiction has an ongoing commitment to providing our
                content to everyone in our community. As part of these efforts, Our Baking Addiction is dedicated to
                offering digital accessibility to all digital offerings, including our website (the “Website”), for all
                our readers. <br><br>

                To assist in achieving our accessibility goals with respect to the Website, Our Baking Addiction works
                diligently to provide a Website that is operated in a manner that complies with generally-recognized and
                accepted guidelines and/or standards, such as using the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), for
                website accessibility (the “Standards”). <br><br>

                Working with experienced accessibility professionals, and becoming educated in how to ensure the Website
                can incorporate these Standards, Our Baking Addiction has voluntarily undertaken efforts to comply with
                these Standards and continue to take the steps necessary to achieve substantial conformance to provide a
                positive experience for our community. We are aware of some areas on the Website where we could improve
                accessibility and are working to achieve this and implement the relevant improvements to meet the
                Standards over time. Please note that our Website may link to, or interface with, third party websites
                that we do not control. <br><br>

                This Website is not compatible with older browsers or mobile operating systems that do not support
                current assistive technologies.
